    <h6>History</h6>
    <p>Alan Turing, known as one of the most famous computer scientists in history, was born on June 23rd, 1912 in London, England, to his father, Julius Mathison Turing, and his mother, Ethel Sara Stoney. Alan Turing had one elder brother, John Turing, who was born on September 1, 1908. His father was a British member of the Indian Civil Service while his mother was the daughter of the chief engineer of the Madras railway, a railway company.</p>
      <p>As Turing grew older, he soon became a well-known English mathematician and computer scientist. He made plenty of contributions to many different subjects . However, his most notable accomplisement was for developing the first ever modern computer, which is why nowadays he has been deemed "the father of modern computer".</p>
 <p>Alan Turing lived a successful, accomplishing life before his unfortunate death in 1954, Wilmslow, Chesire, England, at the age of 41.</p>
    <ul>
      <h6>Contributions to Computer Science:</h6>
      <li>1936: Turing developed the idea for the "Universal Turing Machine", the basis for the first computer</li>
      <li>1940:Turing lead the Bombe project which was used to decipher German Enigma-machine-encrypted secret messages during World War</li>
      <li>1950: developed a test for artificial intelligence which is still being used as of now</li>
    </ul>
        <ul>
          <h6>Extra Facts:</h6>
          <li>Turing was berated for his handwriting and he got many complaints from his teachers.</li>
          <li>Alan's mother was embarrassed by Turing's love for science as she had hoped he would study the classics.</li>
          <li>Turing also studied physics, biology, chemistry, and neurology.</li>
          <li>He developed the theory morphogenesis out of his interest with daisies</li>
          <li>Turing was tortured for being openly gay which, at the time, was a crime in the U.K. This eventually lead to Turing's death. 60 years later, Queen Elizabeth II officially pardoned Turing.</li>
